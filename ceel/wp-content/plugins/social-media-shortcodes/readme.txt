Example 1:

`[twitter name="JoeSomeone" text="some text you want the link to appear as"]`

results in:

`<a href="http://www.twitter.com/JoeSomeone" title="JoeSomeone's Twitter profile\" class="twitter_smsc">some text you want the link to appear as</a>`

on your post/page

Example 2:

`[twitter name="JoeSomeone"]`

results in:

`<a href="http://www.twitter.com/JoeSomeone" title="JoeSomeone's Twitter profile\" class="twitter_smsc">JoeSomeone (Twitter)</a>`

on your post/page.

Example 3:

`[twitter name="JoeSomeone" target="_blank"]`

results in:

`<a href="http://www.twitter.com/JoeSomeone" title="JoeSomeone's Twitter profile\" target="_blank" class="twitter_smsc">JoeSomeone (Twitter)</a>`

on your post/page.

#### Notes
* Setting target to "_self" will not output a target tag, as it's already the default browser behavior.

### Adding your own sites not already listed.
<pre><code>
&lt;?php
add_filter('smsc_shortcodes','myfunc');
function myfunc ( $codes ) {
	$codes['myhandle'] = array ('sitename', 'PATH TO PROFILE URL')
	return $codes;
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

#### Notes
* 'myhandle' is what you use when using the [myhandle] in the actual post.
* 'sitename' is the name of the site to show in the output.
* 'PATHâ€¦' is the part of the url before you enter the user name. For example, Twitter user profiles are http://www.twitter.com/username. You need to specify everything before 'username'. You can see examples if you view the source of the plugin.
