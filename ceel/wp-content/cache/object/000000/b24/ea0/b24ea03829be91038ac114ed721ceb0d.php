While other filmmakers get their hands dirty in kitchen sinks, Wes Anderson surely slips his into luxury cashmere mittens. His films overflow with intricate detail and make no pretence of existing in a world other than their own, just-about-earthbound parallel universe. So the five-star premises of his energetic new comedy â€˜The Grand Budapest Hotelâ€™ â€“ a wedding-cake-like, pastel-coloured establishment situated somewhere in 1930s Mitteleuropa and peopled by eccentrics and lunatics â€“ feel like business as usual. Whatâ€™s different, though, is that the filmâ€™s shaggy-dog, sort-of-whodunit yarn offers laughs and energy that make this Andersonâ€™s most fun film since â€˜Rushmoreâ€™.


Where â€˜Moonrise Kingdomâ€™ had heart, â€˜The Grand Budapest Hotelâ€™ has pace and a winning manic streak. It also gives Ralph Fiennes a rare comic role as Monsieur Gustave, a concierge who wavers brilliantly between thug and gentleman aesthete. From Gustaveâ€™s mouth pours a head-spinning cocktail of politeness and filth as he becomes embroiled in the murder investigation and inheritance tussles that follow the death of one of his most loyal guests, the elderly Madame D (Tilda Swinton, barely recognisable beneath a carapace of make-up). At Gustaveâ€™s side is his loyal apprentice, Zero Moustafa (newcomer Tony Revolori with a drawn-on pencil moustache), who decades later (now played by F Murray Abraham) recounts events over dinner to a writer played by Jude Law.


The rest of Andersonâ€™s cast is sprawling and starry. Blink and you might miss Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman and others in tiny roles. A bruising Adrien Brody and a Rottweiler-like Willem Dafoe represent a violent new European order â€“ one of them is kitted out all in black, no less. In its own indirect and loopy fashion, is this Andersonâ€™s most political film? It tips its hat to 1930s history in the way Hitchcock tipped his viewfinder to the same decadeâ€™s current affairs with â€˜The Lady Vanishesâ€™ (both films share a hotel, a train and an old woman at the centre of a mischievous mystery).


Like the ship of â€˜The Life Aquaticâ€™ or the townhouse of â€˜The Royal Tenenbaumsâ€™, â€˜The Grand Budapest Hotelâ€™ comes with its own ready-made theatre and uniformed cast. From here, Anderson breaks out with verve on to trains, ski runs and cobbled streets to spin a wickedly funny tale that celebrates the final glory days of a dying world order. Itâ€™s all given a bombastic lift by an Alexandre Desplat score which crescendos in organs and drums. Full of Andersonâ€™s visual signatures â€“ cameras that swerve, quick zooms, speedy montages â€“ itâ€™s familiar in style, refreshing in tone and one of Andersonâ€™s very best films.";s:10:"post_title";s:25:" The Grand Budapest Hotel";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:24:"the-grand-budapest-hotel";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:13:55";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:13:55";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://melbrins.com/ceel/?p=281";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
