For the uninitiated, it can be hard to get a handle on the cult French filmmaker Chris Marker. Born Christian Fran√ßois Bouche-Villeneuve in 1921, this ‚Äúbest-known author of unknown movies‚Äù, as he once described himself, was devilishly reclusive: he rarely granted interviews, and resisted having his photograph taken, preferring instead to be represented by images of a cat.
Yet his career (a word that he detested), prior to his death in 2012, was influential. Credited with inventing the ‚Äúessay film‚Äù, a thoughtful and subjective form of documentary elegantly expounding upon a theme like a mishmash of cinema and Montaigne, he is best known for his 1962 sci-fi short La Jet√©e (‚ÄúThe Jetty‚Äù), which inspired Terry Gilliam‚Äôs 12 Monkeys - as well as, more loosely, the Terminator movies. A rare print of La Jet√©e, a dystopian drama almost exclusively told using still images, is currently being shown at the Whitechapel Gallery, as part of the first retrospective of Marker‚Äôs work mounted in Britain.


Even though he could be disarmingly self-deprecating (‚ÄúI make these things and people take me for Plato,‚Äù he once said with disbelief), the point of the retrospective is to suggest the scope of Marker‚Äôs creativity beyond filmmaking. We therefore encounter nearly 80 of his photographs, as well as many of the covetable travel books he edited for the Petite Plan√®te (‚ÄúSmall Planet‚Äù) series during the Fifties, designing their covers and commissioning photographers including Henri Cartier-Bresson and William Klein (Rough Guides, eat your heart out).
Immaculate landmarks in graphic design, these publications testify to Marker‚Äôs lifelong fascination with other cultures - as well as the faces of beautiful women, who invariably grace their covers.

For aficionados of Marker, who served in the Resistance during the Second World War, this material will be diverting. For the rest of us, however, it‚Äôs his films that provide the impetus to visit the Whitechapel. A thing of strange splendour, La Jet√©e remains a masterpiece of pared-down storytelling, involving a time-travelling prisoner from a post-apocalyptic future who falls in love with a woman he once saw on the observation platform or ‚Äújetty‚Äù at Orly Airport.


The print at the Whitechapel includes an alternative opening sequence using moving footage. Marker subsequently rejected this, so that the jarring effect of the film - which famously relies upon photographs appearing on screen in quick succession, a little like a deck of black-and-white picture cards being shuffled and dealt before our eyes - would be established from the start.
Elsewhere, there are also all five of Marker‚Äôs multimedia installations, including Zapping Zone (1990-94), in which 20 blurting television screens compete for our attention within a darkened chamber - a quintessential, and prophetic, work of art, you could argue, for our impatient and hyperactive age.


I was more drawn, though, to the subtler argument of Marker‚Äôs classic early art-historical film Les Statues Meurent Aussi (‚ÄúStatues Also Die‚Äù) from 1953, which he co-directed with Alain Resnais, who once described him as ‚Äúthe prototype of the 21st-century man‚Äù.


Shown in the first gallery, this poetic documentary is a scintillating, whip-smart diatribe against the modish appropriation of African culture by Westerners during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Marker‚Äôs central proposition is that classifying and labelling African tribal sculptures, and locking them away behind glass in museums, robs them of the fervour, mystery and magic with which they were once imbued.


As an argument, this is true - but at the time of its release, the film must also have slyly dismantled assumptions about the benefits of Europe‚Äôs colonisation of Africa. Not everyone will agree with Marker‚Äôs empire-bashing political agenda, but most would concede that it is rare to encounter provocative, polemical filmmaking delivered with such √©lan.
