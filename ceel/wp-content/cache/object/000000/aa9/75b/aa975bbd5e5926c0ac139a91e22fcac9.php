You get to appreciate Cornwall's coastline and mining heritage via an off-road bike ride along the Cornish mining trails between Portreath on the north coast and Devoran on the south. Along the way is the excellent Bike Chain cafe at Bissoe, which serves delicious food â€“ including Cornish cream teas â€“ in a bike-friendly atmosphere. Inside, there's lots of cycling memorabilia â€“ signed jerseys by Tour de France riders and the British Olympic cycle team â€“ and outside, there's a nice veranda to take in the sun.

The Ormond at Tetbury in the Cotswolds is a great bike-friendly hotel. It's a former coaching inn, all designer interiors and boutique chic, but with a dedicated bike room and work stand, and packages that include overnight kit washing, pre-ride bike fettling and carefully planned ride guides around the glorious greenery of the Cotswolds.

The Blue Egg in Great Bardfield, Essex, is the long-standing destination for riders from around the county, as well as South Cambridgeshire and even parts of Hertfordshire. The coffee is good, the cakes are better, and the scones are enormous. It's surrounded by quiet roads, so wherever you're coming from there's a selection of routes to get you there. Even on a midweek morning, there are always bike riders in, often including stars Alex Dowsett or Mark Cavendish, who live locally. And if you want to fill you jersey pockets with bedding plants, there's even a nursery next door.
