The first thing that crops up in any conversation about Amsterdam is its illicit atmosphere, with hookers and hookahs along every canal. But the climate is changing. Last week the city announced it was closing down a third of its infamous brothels, and in April, its "coffee shops" were forced to choose between serving alcohol or dealing in officially-tolerated marijuana. Most chose the weed, but from next summer the Dutch will ban smoking in all public outlets. How exactly this will affect the wacky baccy trade is unclear, but things will never be the same again in one of the world's most progressive and tolerant cities.


However, it's not all bad news. You won't find many locals in the grass emporiums anyhow: most have grown out of those kind of joints (or at least grow their own ‚Ä¶). Ask an Amsterdammer and you will find that the city actually has a thriving caf√© culture to rival anywhere else in Europe. A Dutch caf√© is more than just a greasy spoon: many serve a delectable variety of beers and liqueurs (for actual coffee, hot and made from beans, you need a koffiehuis by the way); some open until 3am or even later.


So take a moment to check out the alternative to the alternative scene. Here's just 10 to try, but if you hit four of Amsterdam's caf√©s every night it would take a year to cover them all. Altogether a far more civilized way to blow your mind ‚Ä¶";s:10:"post_title";s:29:"Top 10 Amsterdam coffee shops";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:29:"top-10-amsterdam-coffee-shops";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:09:56";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:09:56";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://melbrins.com/ceel/?p=305";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
