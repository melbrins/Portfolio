Call me a conspiracy theorist, but is it really coincidence that Francisco de Zurbar√°n‚Äôs name appears last in the index of all art books? Ok, I know, it might have something to do with alphabetical order. But it also reflects the Spanish painter‚Äôs far-from-glorious reputation across the centuries.


Created with the express Counter Reformation purpose of stimulating religious faith, Zurbar√°n‚Äôs intense imagery of martyrs and saints was scorned in much of Northern Europe as too devoutly and dangerously Catholic. In 1853, the Telegraph letters pages were bursting with outrage when the National Gallery purchased his painting of a skull-caressing Saint Francis. ‚ÄúWhy on earth would we have something so black and repulsive in our national collection?‚Äù went one.


In today‚Äôs multi-cultural Britain, such religious prejudice, thankfully, is a thing of the past, and we can better appreciate Zurbar√°n purely on painterly terms. Yet, even this isn‚Äôt easy. His tenebrous works were intended for a very specific context ‚Äì hushed, candlelit, Andalusian churches ‚Äì but Napoleon‚Äôs forces looted so many of them in the Peninsular Wars one almost invariably now encounters them elsewhere.


Credit, then, to the bold Brussels curators, who are staging the first Zurbar√°n exhibition outside Spain in 27 years. Aptly, the display is in almost complete darkness, and in the case of 1635‚Äôs Christ on the Cross, the result is stunning. In a break with tradition, the Crucifixion is no longer a crowded, mob scene, but a solitary one ‚Äì depicted with enough naturalism to convince the praying believer that Christ has appeared before his eyes.


In trademark Zurbar√°n fashion, He emerges in raking light from a black void. These are chiaroscuro effects worthy of Hollywood and, more pertinently, Caravaggio, whose influence was keenly felt in Spanish art of the 17th century.


Zurbar√°n specialised in heightened realism, rendering everyday matter divine through numinous light. In Agnus Dei, a dead lamb on a ledge, legs bound, is transcended by the touches of luminescent paint on its fleece that rescue it from darkness and suggest Christ‚Äôs role as sacrificial lamb.";s:10:"post_title";s:62:"Zurbar√°n, at Bozar, Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels ‚Äì review";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:54:"zurbaran-at-bozar-centre-for-fine-arts-brussels-review";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:09:43";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:09:43";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://melbrins.com/ceel/?p=314";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
