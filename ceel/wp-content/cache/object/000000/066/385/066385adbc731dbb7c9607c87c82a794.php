Land sakes! Another book about Winston Churchill? Really? Give us a break, the average reader may think. Actually though, as title and subtitle suggest, this isn‚Äôt just another biographical study. It‚Äôs at once odder and more conventional than that. More conventional because, in some ways, it is just another biographical study. Odder because ‚Äî instead of being a straightforward discussion of Churchill‚Äôs literary work ‚Äî it sees literature as the key to his biography. More than that, its author seems to think he has hit on a ‚Äònew methodology‚Äô in which ‚Äòwe can write political history as literary history‚Äô.


Well, perhaps. At one end of that notion is the banality that politics is ‚Äòshowbusiness for ugly people‚Äô; at the other are airy overclaims such as that Churchill was ‚Äòan artist who used politics as his creative medium, as other writers used paper‚Äô.


Rose is too imprecise, and too infatuated with his conceit, to quite get an anchor into the solid stuff. Of course, political performance involves literary ‚Äî i.e. rhetorical ‚Äî use of language; it involves narrative shape; it will be influenced by the politician‚Äôs exposure to all sorts of literary texts and performances, and all of this may be explored with profit. But it‚Äôs not quite enough to treat political history, or the decisions of politicians, as if they were interchangeable with aesthetic or literary behaviour.


On the other hand, if ever there were a politician susceptible of this sort of treatment, it is Churchill. His Nobel prize was, after all, for literature ‚Äî the peace prize perhaps by that stage looking like a non-runner. He was a journalist, historian, novelist and biographer ‚Äî as well as, in the event, saviour of the free world. He was a fantastic ham. He was a shameless hack and self-promoter. And as contemporary after contemporary attested, he was capable of talking himself into almost anything when he got excited. Words led: thought followed.


More than that, there‚Äôs strong evidence that Churchill really did have one eye on how he was going to write things up afterwards, and that that influenced what he did. Chamberlain wondered mildly, for instance, why ‚Äòhe continually writes me letters many pages long‚Äô given that they saw each-other every day in war cabinet: ‚ÄòOf course I realise these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the book that he will write hereafter.‚Äô";s:10:"post_title";s:59:"Churchill was as mad as a badger.
