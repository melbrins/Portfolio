Mysore, once the capital of a princely kingdom in South India, has lost its lustre. In Mahesh Rao‚Äôs darkly comic novel, grandiose futuristic visions are being floated: in a city desperate to reinvent itself for today‚Äôs brave new world, ancient temples and palaces are no longer enough. With India‚Äôs space programme about to send a man to the moon, Mysore must make its own giant leap. All hopes are pinned on what is destined to be a global tourist attraction: HeritageLand, planned as Asia‚Äôs largest theme park (think Mughal Waterworld ‚Äî the Disneyland of south India!) And Mysore needs a new marketing slogan ‚Äî ‚ÄòThe Geneva of the East?‚Äô  suggests a desperate PR person. Well, at least there‚Äôs a lake.


While local government officials pull strings, line pockets and bully those they can in the cause of the great transformation, everyday life goes on. The city itself is a leading character: security-protected enclave and suede-panelled restaurant for the affluent; nightspots for cool youth; down-market coffee houses for office workers, slums clinging like barnacles to the respectable rim of town. Further out are the fields where farmers scrape a living off land about to be snatched away from them in the name of progress. Opulence and quiet desperation in tandem.


The Smoke is Rising scrutinises some of those lives: the elderly widow grown invisible, as elderly widows do, until she glimpses a chance of new happiness‚Ä¶ the servant with a past she is trying to escape, drawn into a scandal with disastrous consequences‚Ä¶ and ‚Äî in the novel‚Äôs most powerful and unsettling thread ‚Äî a young wife trapped in a life of domestic sadism.


Glancingly we encounter others ‚Äî ambitious bureaucrats, social climbers, unscrupulous entrepreneurs, no-hopers ‚Äî all struggling in the urban jungle where the modern world rides roughshod over tradition in a bitter clash between consumerism and old India. The rich get richer and the poor stay where they always were ‚Äî bottom of the pile, like those cheated farmers. Driven by despair they plan a violent revenge.
