What do you say to a priest you plan to shoot pointblank between the eyes? â€˜Say your prayers,â€™ of course. Part â€˜Father Tedâ€™, part Tarantino, John Michael McDonagh follows up 2011â€™s â€˜The Guardâ€™ with this wickedly funny black comedy, all fatalism and gallows humour, with both a beating heart and an inquiring mind lingering beneath its tough-guy bluster.


The mighty Brendan Gleeson â€“ a man built like a wardrobe, with a face like heâ€™s been left on a cliff-edge, battered by north winds â€“ plays Father James, a good priest. In the confession box, a man tells him how he was raped by a priest at the age of seven. That priest is now dead, so itâ€™s Father James who must pay. The mystery voice gives James seven days to put his affairs in order: the murder is fixed for next Sunday.


Donâ€™t go expecting a priestly Poirot. This is a sly, shaggy-dog mystery. McDonagh (whose brother Martin wrote and directed â€˜In Brugesâ€™ and â€˜Seven Psychopathsâ€™) casts the best of Irish as the frankly insane locals. Any one of them might be the would-be culprit. Is it the coke-snorting cynical local doctor (Aidan Gillen)? The intellectually-challenged racist butcher (Chris Oâ€™Dowd)? There is some brilliant comedy among this lineup of oddballs. Best of all is Dylan Moran, playing a man who might be the evil twin of the shop owner he played in the TV series â€˜Black Booksâ€™: heâ€™s similarly alcoholic, foul-mouthed and self-loathing, but this time heâ€™s also filthy rich, one of the bankers who shafted Ireland.


But you wonâ€™t find as many big guffaws as in â€˜The Guardâ€™. Thereâ€™s a little less of the rapid-fire blarney, and â€˜Calvaryâ€™ has its flaws â€“ not all the characters tickle, and itâ€™s slipshod in places. McDonaghâ€™s brand of surreal, paint-it-black humour is an acquired taste as it slips in the big questions. Whatâ€™s the point? Isnâ€™t it all completely meaningless? Why would God create a serial killer? Thatâ€™ll be a shade too dark for some. Everyone else, sit back and enjoy. And hats off to Gleeson, for a career-best â€“ an authentic, heart-and-soul performance. Whatever the weather, he has a face you could watch for hours.";s:10:"post_title";s:7:"Calvary";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:7:"calvary";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:13:49";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-04-21 14:13:49";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://melbrins.com/ceel/?p=284";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
