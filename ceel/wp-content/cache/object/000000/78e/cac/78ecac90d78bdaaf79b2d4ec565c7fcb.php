Be honest. I promise to keep this strictly between us. But when you hear the name John Ruskin, what springs to mind? His theories on art, architecture, the environment, social welfare and unchecked capitalism ‚Äì in short, the wisdom that prompted Tolstoy to hail ‚Äúone of the most remarkable men of all countries and times‚Äù? Or his infamous wedding night with Effie Gray?
I refer (as if you needed reminding) to the non-consummation of his marriage, apocryphally attributed to Ruskin‚Äôs horror at the sight of his wife‚Äôs pubic hair, which compared so indecorously with the marmoreal smoothness of Classical nudes.


The Victorian sage wrote so many books on so many topics, it can be hard today to get a handle on his beliefs. Much more riveting to focus on his bedroom demons, Ruskin being one of countless Victorian luminaries (Carroll and Carlyle others) whose hang-ups characterise that sexually tortuous era.


In 2013, author Robert Brownwell published Marriage of Inconvenience, a 600-page tome about what really happened in Ruskin and Effie‚Äôs boudoir, while later this year Emma Thompson releases Effie, a film all about their troubled union.
