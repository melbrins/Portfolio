This former fruit warehouse is now Carnivore Central in Will Beckett and Huw Gottâ€™s confidently expanding empire, and the bar a place of pilgrimage in its own right for cocktail geeks.

Winner of Time Outâ€™s Best New Restaurant award in 2011, the discreet-fronted basement location is elevated to a high-end destination with a characterful interior of reclaimed materials and the fan-boysâ€™ zeal for premium meats and other taste sensations. The bad news is, with a similar appreciation of gustatory pleasures (a couple of cocktails, say, followed by crab or lobster, sirloin and side dishes, wine and pudding), dinner here can easily set you back Â£100 a head.

The good news is the express menu (ideal pre-theatre when tables are easy to snare) proffers two courses for Â£22 and three courses for Â£25 â€“ and still allows enjoyment of fine Ginger Pig Longhorn ribeye (a more-than-strictly-needed 250g), and bone marrow with onions. Desserts here, in our experience, donâ€™t benefit from the same obsessive attention to detail as the beef dripping chips, kimchi burger, hot dogs or historic anti-fogmatics â€“ still, thereâ€™s the post-prandial cocktail list to peruse featuring the likes of Climpsonâ€™s espresso martini.";s:10:"post_title";s:21:"Hawksmoor Seven Dials";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:21:"hawksmoor-seven-dials";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-05-14 19:37:30";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-05-14 19:37:30";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://melbrins.com/ceel/?p=512";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
